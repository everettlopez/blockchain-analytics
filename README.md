# PocketChain
This project is a full‑stack blockchain analytics dashboard built to demonstrate professional‑grade engineering skills across backend architecture, API integration, data modeling, and frontend visualization.

## Features
- Wallet‑Linked Accounts: Users create an account and associate a blockchain wallet address. The dashboard dynamically loads balances, transactions, and token metadata using Alchemy’s APIs.

- Real-Time Market Data: Live token prices and market metrics are fetched from the CoinMarketCap API and displayed in a responsive analytics panel.
